## Leveraging external data in Bayesian adaptive platform designs using Stan

There is growing interest in trial designs that incorporate data from real world observational studies or from previous completed trials with the goal of increasing power and reduce the sample size of clinical studies. However, if the outcome distributions of the external and internal data differ, the integration of external data may lead to biased treatment effects estimates, reduced power or increased type I error rates. We introduce a novel design that leverages external data via a Bayesian model averaging approach. Our design is fitted using Stan, for which we provide methods to perform the final and interim analyses of the trial.
